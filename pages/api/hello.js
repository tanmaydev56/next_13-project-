// Next.js is a popular open-source framework for building web applications using React. Developed and maintained by Vercel, it extends React's capabilities by offering a powerful,
//  easy-to-use solution for creating server-rendered applications, static websites, and hybrid applications. Here are some key features:
// Server-Side Rendering (SSR)(automatically generates the html for each request) , Static Site Generation (SSG): Pre-renders pages at build time, providing fast loading speeds and better SEO.
// API Routes: Allows building API endpoints within the application, eliminating the need for a separate backend.
// Automatic Code Splitting: Breaks the application into smaller bundles, optimizing loading time.
// Built-in CSS and Sass support: Allows styling components using CSS and Sass without additional configuration.


// 
// Both Next.js 13 and Next.js 14 represent significant steps forward in the evolution of the Next.js framework. Next.js 13 brought new features 
// like the App Directory and React Server Components, while Next.js 14 built on these with stable releases and added functionalities such 
// as Server Actions and enhanced performance optimizations. These
//  versions reflect a continuous effort to enhance the developer experience, performance, and capabilities of web applications built with Next.js.
